{"question_type":"strategy_analysis","scenario":"A MEME coin called AlphaDog announced it would airdrop token rewards to early holders. After the announcement， there was a buying frenzy in the market， with many investors purchasing and holding the coin to qualify for the airdrop (fearing they would miss out on the airdrop benefits)， causing AlphaDog's price to double in a short time. After the airdrop snapshot and token distribution were completed， many investors who received the airdrop tokens began selling to cash out， creating enormous selling pressure， and the price plummeted by 40% within two days.

His post generated strong market attention， with BetaCoin's price soaring 150% that day.

{"question_type":"short_answer","scenario":"A newly issued MEME coin called DeltaCoin claimed to be launching a revolutionary product， attracting widespread investor attention. The project team heavily promoted on social media， generating enthusiastic community discussion. Driven by fear of missing out (FOMO)， DeltaCoin's price skyrocketed 10x in a week， with many investors buying at high prices despite the risks. However， late one night， the project team suddenly withdrew all funds from the liquidity pool and sold their large holdings of tokens (executing a rug pull)， causing DeltaCoin's price to instantly collapse to near zero， resulting in devastating losses for many investors.
